jpr is that going to happen?
jpr i guess its mostly the non-mass storage cameras at issue right now?
fejj yea, larry and I are discussing that
fejj how it should work, etc
fejj but yea, I think I'll be finished this week
jpr ok, let me know if not
jpr what device type is next?
jpr the dialog for the user to choose also needs to happen
* jpr looks at the feature freeze for gnome data
jpr date
fejj ok
fejj I'l get crackin on that tomorrow or next week
jpr ok
jpr did you talk to ui about what to do?
fejj (to amke sure I'm clear: dialog prompt for CD Audio play/burn right?)
jpr yah, and for whatever else we have multiple actions
fejj ok
fejj yea, I talked to anna
jpr i mean, if you want to ask nld-dev or the ui team for an alternative
jpr but i don't see away around it really
jpr (maybe an "always do this checkbox"
jpr )
fejj she suggested that to start with, we implement the prompt with an "always" checkbox
fejj right
jpr ok, lets do that
fejj ok
jpr we can always change it if it sucks
fejj right
jpr got a time estimate on the dialog work?
fejj can you think of any dialogs other than CD play/burn?
fejj if only that one, I can have it done by end of day Monday
fejj assuming no more complications with my machine :)
fejj (currently having issues with hal not noticing my ipod's partitions)
jpr blank CDs
fejj ok
jpr ipods if other than music
fejj what should that dialog prompt? burn vs ignore?
fejj ah, good call about ipods
jpr wasn't the blank cd thing discussed on nld-dev?
jpr you can burn photos, music
jpr or data
jpr for instance
jpr how long for the dialog work?
fejj should be done by end of next week
